question 1:
average energy = 0.66
average danceability = 0.72
average valence = 0.48

valence is below 0.5 which puts the listener in sad/angry music range.
energy is above 0.5 so it puts listener in the anrgy energetic music range.
energetic angry/happy music that allows to dance is their aura

question 2:
the above method is quite good to determine aura, but you can also include genre
and tempo to make it even more accurate.
